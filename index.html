        <p><strong>To my Highness/Disney Princess/Admin Pro,</strong></p>

        <p>
          happy anniversary disney princess, thank you for staying with me even though we don't always agree because, like you said, we're both fire, but somehow, you still manage to emerge victorious as a "undefeated champion" and it makes me fall more you more. thank you for being my motivation to strive for more even when i doubt myself. even though we are far apart, you've never felt far in my mind and my heart. and without a doubt, i will always choose to be with you every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          yours always,<br>
          <strong>Mateo</strong>
